Unlike standard weather events, Playtime Luck is client-bound, meaning it only applies to the individual player who activated it and is not shared across the server.\nThis event is rare and may trigger shortly after a player joins a server. When active, a four-leaf clover icon appears in the screen corner just like normal weather events. Once triggered, Playtime Luck lasts for the entire duration of the player’s current session.\nIt increases luck, seed pack luck, the chances of jumbo fruit, and luck with mutations.\nAs the player continues playing on the same server, their luck increases in stages. Each milestone likely increases the likelihood of crop mutations, synergizing well with other active weather or event conditions.\nPlaytime Luck increases a player's base drop rate by a percentage depending on how long they’ve remained in the same server. This boost is additive to the base chance, not multiplicative to the total probability.\nAdjusted Chance = Base Chance × (1 + Luck Bonus %)\nSo with +100% Playtime Luck, a 0.5% base chance becomes\n0.5% × (1 + 1.00) = 1.0%\nObtaining a 100% luck boost doubles the original base luck (x2).\nTrigger Chance: Very low upon server join.\nDuration: Active for the entire session once triggered.\nIcon: Displays a clover (🍀) in the weather UI slot.\nVisibility: Only visible to the player who activated the event.\nPlaytime Luck is one of the only client-specific events in the game."}
